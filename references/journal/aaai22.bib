abstract = {Detecting anomalous subsequences in time series data is an important task in areas ranging from manufacturing processes over finance applications to health care monitoring. An anomaly can indicate important events, such as production faults, delivery bottlenecks, system defects, or heart flicker, and is therefore of central interest. Because time series are often large and exhibit complex patterns, data scientists have developed various specialized algorithms for the automatic detection of such anomalous patterns. The number and variety of anomaly detection algorithms has grown significantly in the past and, because many of these solutions have been developed independently and by different research communities, there is no comprehensive study that systematically evaluates and compares the different approaches. For this reason, choosing the best detection technique for a given anomaly detection task is a difficult challenge.This comprehensive, scientific study carefully evaluates most state-of-the-art anomaly detection algorithms. We collected and re-implemented 71 anomaly detection algorithms from different domains and evaluated them on 976 time series datasets. The algorithms have been selected from different algorithm families and detection approaches to represent the entire spectrum of anomaly detection techniques. In the paper, we provide a concise overview of the techniques and their commonalities; we evaluate their individual strengths and weaknesses and, thereby, consider factors, such as effectiveness, efficiency, and robustness. Our experimental results should ease the algorithm selection problem and open up new research directions.},

The Python package tsfresh (Time Series FeatuRe Extraction on basis of Scalable Hypothesis tests) accelerates this process by combining 63 time series characterization methods, which by default compute a total of 794 time series features, with feature selection on basis automatically configured hypothesis tests. By identifying statistically significant time series characteristics in an early stage of the data science process, tsfresh closes feedback loops with domain experts and fosters the development of domain specific features early on. The package implements standard APIs of time series and machine learning libraries (e.g. pandas and scikit-learn) and is designed for both exploratory analyses as well as straightforward integration into operational data science applications.}

year = {2022},
volume = {15},
number = {8},
abstract = {The detection of anomalies in time series has gained ample academic and industrial attention. However, no comprehensive benchmark exists to evaluate time-series anomaly detection methods. It is common to use (i) proprietary or synthetic data, often biased to support particular claims; or (ii) a limited collection of publicly available datasets. Consequently, we often observe methods performing exceptionally well in one dataset but surprisingly poorly in another, creating an illusion of progress. To address the issues above, we thoroughly studied over one hundred papers to identify, collect, process, and systematically format datasets proposed in the past decades. We summarize our effort in TSB-UAD, a new benchmark to ease the evaluation of univariate time-series anomaly detection methods. Overall, TSB-UAD contains 13766 time series with labeled anomalies spanning different domains with high variability of anomaly types, ratios, and sizes. TSB-UAD includes 18 previously proposed datasets containing 1980 time series and we contribute two collections of datasets. Specifically, we generate 958 time series using a principled methodology for transforming 126 time-series classification datasets into time series with labeled anomalies. In addition, we present data transformations with which we introduce new anomalies, resulting in 10828 time series with varying complexity for anomaly detection. Finally, we evaluate 12 representative methods demonstrating that TSB-UAD is a robust resource for assessing anomaly detection methods. We make our data and code available at www.timeseries.org/TSB-UAD. TSB-UAD provides a valuable, reproducible, and frequently updated resource to establish a leaderboard of univariate time-series anomaly detection methods.},

	abstract = {The last decade has seen a flurry of research on all-pairs-similarity-search (or similarity joins) for text, DNA and a handful of other datatypes, and these systems have been applied to many diverse data mining problems. However, there has been surprisingly little progress made on similarity joins for time series subsequences. The lack of progress probably stems from the daunting nature of the problem. For even modest sized datasets the obvious nested-loop algorithm can take months, and the typical speed-up techniques in this domain (i.e., indexing, lower-bounding, triangular-inequality pruning and early abandoning) at best produce only one or two orders of magnitude speedup. In this work we introduce a novel scalable algorithm for time series subsequence all-pairs-similarity-search. For exceptionally large datasets, the algorithm can be trivially cast as an anytime algorithm and produce high-quality approximate solutions in reasonable time and/or be accelerated by a trivial porting to a GPU framework. The exact similarity join algorithm computes the answer to the time series motif and time series discord problem as a side-effect, and our algorithm incidentally provides the fastest known algorithm for both these extensively-studied problems. We demonstrate the utility of our ideas for many time series data mining problems, including motif discovery, novelty discovery, shapelet discovery, semantic segmentation, density estimation, and contrast set mining. Moreover, we demonstrate the utility of our ideas on domains as diverse as seismology, music processing, bioinformatics, human activity monitoring, electrical power-demand monitoring and medicine.},

However, the approaches that have been proposed so far in the literature have severe limitations: they either require prior domain knowledge or become cumbersome and expensive to use in situations with recurrent anomalies of the same type. In this work, we address these problems and propose NormA, a novel approach, suitable for domain-agnostic anomaly detection. NormA is based on a new data series primitive, which permits to detect anomalies based on their (dis)similarity to a model that represents normal behavior. The experimental results on several real datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach correctly identifies all single and recurrent anomalies of various types, with no prior knowledge of the characteristics of these anomalies (except for their length). Moreover, it outperforms by a large margin the current state-of-the art algorithms in terms of accuracy, while being orders of magnitude faster.},

This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iForest performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and random forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},

In this paper, we use stacked LSTM networks for anomaly/fault detection in time series. A network is trained on non-anomalous data and used as a predictor over a number of time steps. The resulting prediction errors are modeled as a multivariate Gaussian distribution, which is used to assess the likelihood of anomalous behavior. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated on four datasets: ECG, space shuttle, power demand, and multi-sensor engine dataset.},

This paper explores the relationship between these two issues, and presents a unifying method for dealing with both of them. Previous approaches often use parametric techniques and try to give exact results. In contrast, we present a nonparametric method based on local polynomial fitting, and give approximate results by fuzzy partition and decision. In order to measure the possibility of being an outlier and a change point, two novel score functions are defined based on the forward and backward prediction errors. The proposed method can detect outliers and changes simultaneously,and can distinguish between them. Comparing to the conventional parametric approaches, our method is more convenient for implementation, and more appropriate for online and interactive data mining. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

The functional form of f is given by a kernel expansion in terms of a potentially small subset of the training data; it is regularized by controlling the length of the weight vector in an associated feature space. We provide a theoretical analysis of the statistical performance of our algorithm. The algorithm is a natural extension of the support vector algorithm to the case of unlabelled data.},

abstract = {This paper proposes to use autoencoders with nonlinear dimensionality reduction in
the anomaly detection task. The authors apply dimensionality reduction by using an
autoencoder onto both artificial data and real data, and compare it with linear PCA
and kernel PCA to clarify its property. The artificial data is generated from Lorenz
system, and the real data is the spacecrafts' telemetry data. This paper demonstrates
that autoencoders are able to detect subtle anomalies which linear PCA fails. Also,
autoencoders can increase their accuracy by extending them to denoising autoenconders.
Moreover, autoencoders can be useful as nonlinear techniques without complex computation
as kernel PCA requires. Finaly, the authors examine the learned features in the hidden
layer of autoencoders, and present that autoencoders learn the normal state properly
and activate differently with anomalous input.},

abstract = {Time-series of count data are generated in many different contexts, such as web access
logging, freeway traffic monitoring, and security logs associated with buildings.
Since this data measures the aggregated behavior of individual human beings, it typically
exhibits a periodicity in time on a number of scales (daily, weekly,etc.) that reflects
the rhythms of the underlying human activity and makes the data appear non-homogeneous.
At the same time, the data is often corrupted by a number of bursty periods of unusual
behavior such as building events, traffic accidents, and so forth. The data mining
problem of finding and extracting these anomalous events is made difficult by both
of these elements. In this paper we describe a framework for unsupervised learning
in this context, based on a time-varying Poisson process model that can also account
for anomalous events. We show how the parameters of this model can be learned from
count time series using statistical estimation techniques. We demonstrate the utility
of this model on two datasets for which we have partial ground truth in the form of
known events, one from freeway traffic data and another from building access data,
and show that the model performs significantly better than a non-probabilistic, threshold-based
technique. We also describe how the model can be used to investigate different degrees
of periodicity in the data, including systematic day-of-week and time-of-day effects,
and make inferences about the detected events (e.g., popularity or level of attendance).
Our experimental results indicate that the proposed time-varying Poisson model provides
a robust and accurate framework for adaptively and autonomously learning how to separate
unusual bursty events from traces of normal human activity.},

	abstract = {We are seeing an enormous increase in the availability of streaming, time-series data. Largely driven by the rise of connected real-time data sources, this data presents technical challenges and opportunities. One fundamental capability for streaming analytics is to model each stream in an unsupervised fashion and detect unusual, anomalous behaviors in real-time. Early anomaly detection is valuable, yet it can be difficult to execute reliably in practice. Application constraints require systems to process data in real-time, not batches. Streaming data inherently exhibits concept drift, favoring algorithms that learn continuously. Furthermore, the massive number of independent streams in practice requires that anomaly detectors be fully automated. In this paper we propose a novel anomaly detection algorithm that meets these constraints. The technique is based on an online sequence memory algorithm called Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM). We also present results using the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB), a benchmark containing real-world data streams with labeled anomalies. The benchmark, the first of its kind, provides a controlled open-source environment for testing anomaly detection algorithms on streaming data. We present results and analysis for a wide range of algorithms on this benchmark, and discuss future challenges for the emerging field of streaming analytics.},

Given the large volume of measurements collected by sensor systems, one problem arises—an automated approach to identifying the “interesting” parts of these datasets, or anomaly detection. A good anomaly detection methodology should be able to accurately identify many types of anomaly, be robust, require relatively few resources, and perform detection in (near) real time. Thus, in this paper, we focus on an approach to online anomaly detection in measurements collected by sensor systems, where our evaluation, using real-world datasets, shows that our approach is accurate (it detects over 90\% of the anomalies with few false positives), works well over a range of parameter choices, and has a small (CPU, memory) footprint.}

very different characteristics), and which can have uncertainty in their values (e.g.,
due to inherent errors in the measurements). Just like databases abstracted the relational
data management problem and offered a black box solution that is now omnipresent,
the proposed system will allow analysts that are not experts in data series management,
as well as common users, to tap in the goldmine of the massive and ever-growing data
series collections they (already) have},

abstract = {Recent studies in the field of diagnostics and prognostics of machines have highlighted the key role played by non-stationarity – often in the form of cyclostationarity – or non-Gaussianity – often in the form of impulsiveness as characteristic symptoms of abnormality. Traditional diagnostic and prognostic indicators (e.g. the kurtosis) are however sensitive to both types of symptoms without being able to differentiate them. In an effort to investigate how the signal characteristics evolve with the different phases of machine components degradation, this paper proposes a new family of condition indicators able to track cyclostationary or non-Gaussian symptoms independently. A statistical methodology based on the maximum likelihood ratio is introduced as a general framework to design condition indicators. It arrives with the possibility of setting up statistical thresholds, as needed for a reliable diagnosis. The methodology is validated with numerically generated signals and applied to the dataset made available by NSF I/UCR Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS). This particular application shows high potential for bearing prognostics by providing condition indicators able to describe different phases of the bearing degradation process.}

abstract = {The last decade has witnessed spectacular advances in vibration-based fault detection of rotating machines and, in particular, rolling element bearings. Nowadays, the related state of the art can be considered mature thanks to a set of powerful signal processing techniques able to denoise and process the vibration signal to detect fault symptoms. Among these techniques, two emerging approaches have specifically captured the interest of the scientific community thanks to their efficiency and robustness. They have also been recommended in the bearing diagnostic tutorial written by professors R. B. Randall and J. Antoni, published in MSSP in 2011. The first approach consists of pre-processing the random part of the vibration signal (after removal of deterministic components) through the minimum entropy deconvolution (MED) method, followed by the spectral kurtosis (SK), before analyzing the spectrum of the signal envelope. The MED enhances the signal impulsivity by deconvolving the system transfer function through an optimization approach that maximizes the kurtosis of the filter output. Then, the SK is applied to conceive the optimal filter that promotes the most informative spectral band before computing the (squared) envelope spectrum. The second approach is based on a cyclostationary modeling of the bearing signal. It applies a bi-variable map— called the spectral coherence— of (i) the cyclic frequency, which describes the cyclic content of modulations, and (ii) the spectral frequency which describes the spectral content of the carrier. When applied to the random part of the signal, this quantity is able to detail the signal in this plane according to the signal-to-noise ratio, thus allowing weak fault components to appear in the distribution. This paper investigates and compares these two approaches on real bearing vibration datasets including run-to-failure tests. The study also addresses the extension of these approaches to the nonstationary operating regime.}

abstract = {The proliferation and ubiquity of temporal data across many disciplines has generated
substantial interest in the analysis and mining of time series. Clustering is one
of the most popular data mining methods, not only due to its exploratory power, but
also as a preprocessing step or subroutine for other techniques. In this paper, we
describe k-Shape, a novel algorithm for time-series clustering. k-Shape relies on
a scalable iterative refinement procedure, which creates homogeneous and well-separated
clusters. As its distance measure, k-Shape uses a normalized version of the cross-correlation
measure in order to consider the shapes of time series while comparing them. Based
on the properties of that distance measure, we develop a method to compute cluster
centroids, which are used in every iteration to update the assignment of time series
to clusters. An extensive experimental evaluation against partitional, hierarchical,
and spectral clustering methods, with the most competitive distance measures, showed
the robustness of k-Shape. Overall, k-Shape emerges as a domain-independent, highly
accurate, and efficient clustering approach for time series with broad applications.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed the unprecedented rising of time series from almost all
kindes of academic and industrial fields. Various types of deep neural network models
have been introduced to time series analysis, but the important frequency information
is yet lack of effective modeling. In light of this, in this paper we propose a wavelet-based
neural network structure called multilevel Wavelet Decomposition Network (mWDN) for
building frequency-aware deep learning models for time series analysis. mWDN preserves
the advantage of multilevel discrete wavelet decomposition in frequency learning while
enables the fine-tuning of all parameters under a deep neural network framework. Based
on mWDN, we further propose two deep learning models called Residual Classification
Flow (RCF) and multi-frequecy Long Short-Term Memory (mLSTM) for time series classification
and forecasting, respectively. The two models take all or partial mWDN decomposed
sub-series in different frequencies as input, and resort to the back propagation algorithm
to learn all the parameters globally, which enables seamless embedding of wavelet-based
frequency analysis into deep learning frameworks. Extensive experiments on 40 UCR
datasets and a real-world user volume dataset demonstrate the excellent performance
of our time series models based on mWDN. In particular, we propose an importance analysis
method to mWDN based models, which successfully identifies those time-series elements
and mWDN layers that are crucially important to time series analysis. This indeed
indicates the interpretability advantage of mWDN, and can be viewed as an indepth
exploration to interpretable deep learning.},

models sharing the same fixed deterministically constructed state transition part
to individual time series. The proposed kernels can naturally handle time series of
different length without the need to specify a parametric model class for the time
series. Compared with most time series kernels, our kernels are computationally efficient.
We show how the model distances used in the kernel can be calculated analytically
or efficiently estimated. The experimental results on synthetic and benchmark time
series classification tasks confirm the efficiency of the proposed kernel in terms
of both generalization accuracy and computational speed. This paper also investigates
on-line reservoir kernel construction for extremely long time series.},

research areas and application domains. Many anomaly detection techniques have been

This survey tries to provide a structured and comprehensive overview of the research

based on the underlying approach adopted by each technique. For each category we have
identified key assumptions, which are used by the techniques to differentiate between
normal and anomalous behavior. When applying a given technique to a particular domain,
these assumptions can be used as guidelines to assess the effectiveness of the technique
in that domain. For each category, we provide a basic anomaly detection technique,
and then show how the different existing techniques in that category are variants
of the basic technique. This template provides an easier and more succinct understanding
of the techniques belonging to each category. Further, for each category, we identify
the advantages and disadvantages of the techniques in that category. We also provide
a discussion on the computational complexity of the techniques since it is an important
issue in real application domains. We hope that this survey will provide a better
understanding of the different directions in which research has been done on this
topic, and how techniques developed in one area can be applied in domains for which
they were not intended to begin with.},

approximately repeated subsequences in a longer time series. In an earlier work, we
formalized the idea of approximately repeated subsequences by introducing the notion
of time series motifs. Two limitations of this work were the poor scalability of the
motif discovery algorithm, and the inability to discover motifs in the presence of
noise.Here we address these limitations by introducing a novel algorithm inspired
by recent advances in the problem of pattern discovery in biosequences. Our algorithm
is probabilistic in nature, but as we show empirically and theoretically, it can find
time series motifs with very high probability even in the presence of noise or "don't
care" symbols. Not only is the algorithm fast, but it is an anytime algorithm, producing
likely candidate motifs almost immediately, and gradually improving the quality of
results over time.},

                   patterns foundwithin the data. Such motifs have
                   utility for many data mining algorithms, including
                   rule-discovery,novelty-detection, summarization and
                   clustering. Since the formalization of the problem
                   and the introduction of efficient linear time
                   algorithms, motif discovery has been successfully
                   applied tomany domains, including medicine, motion
                   capture, robotics and meteorology.In this work we
                   show that most previous applications of time series
                   motifs have been severely limited by the definition's
                   brittleness to even slight changes of uniform
                   scaling, the speed at which the patterns develop. We
                   introduce a new algorithm that allows discovery of
                   time series motifs with invariance to uniform
                   scaling, and show that it produces objectively
                   superior results in several important domains. Apart
                   from being more general than all other motifdiscovery
                   algorithms, a further contribution of our work isthat
                   it is simpler than previous approaches, in particular
                   we have drastically reduced the number of parameters

types of data, including telephone records, Web documents, and clickstreams. For analysis
of such data, the ability to process the data in a single pass, or a small number

abstract = {With precipitously growing demand to detect outliers in data streams, many studies
have been conducted aiming to develop extensions of well-known outlier detection algorithm
called Local Outlier Factor (LOF), for data streams. However, existing LOF-based algorithms
for data streams still suffer from two inherent limitations: 1) Large amount of memory
space is required. 2) A long sequence of outliers is not detected. In this paper,
we propose a new outlier detection algorithm for data streams, called DILOF that effectively
overcomes the limitations. To this end, we first develop a novel density-based sampling
algorithm to summarize past data and then propose a new strategy for detecting a sequence
of outliers. It is worth noting that our proposing algorithms do not require any prior
knowledge or assumptions on data distribution. Moreover, we accelerate the execution
time of DILOF about 15 times by developing a powerful distance approximation technique.
Our comprehensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that DILOF significantly
outperforms the state-of-the-art competitors in terms of accuracy and execution time.
The source code for the proposed algorithm is available at our website: http://di.postech.ac.kr/DILOF.},

of the anomaly detection algorithms depend on an explicit definition of anomaly, which
may be impossible to elicit from a domain expert. Using discords as anomaly detectors
is useful since less parameter setting is required. Keogh et al proposed an efficient
method for solving this problem. However, their algorithm requires users to choose
the word size for the compression of subsequences. In this paper, we propose an algorithm
which can dynamically determine the word size for compression. Our method is based
on some properties of the Haar wavelet transformation. Our experiments show that this
method is highly effective.},

abstract = {Time series discord has proven to be a useful concept for time-series anomaly identification.
To search for discords, various algorithms have been developed. Most of these algorithms
rely on pre-building an index (such as a trie) for subsequences. Users of these algorithms
are typically required to choose optimal values for word-length and/or alphabet-size
parameters of the index, which are not intuitive. In this paper, we propose an algorithm
to directly search for the top-K discords, without the requirement of building an
index or tuning external parameters. The algorithm exploits quasi-periodicity present
in many time series. For quasi-periodic time series, the algorithm gains significant
speedup by reducing the number of calls to the distance function.},

abstract = {The discovery of conserved (repeated) patterns in time series is arguably the most
important primitive in time series data mining. Called time series motifs, these primitive
patterns are useful in their own right, and are also used as inputs into classification,
clustering, segmentation, visualization, and anomaly detection algorithms. Recently
the Matrix Profile has emerged as a promising representation to allow the efficient
exact computation of the top-k motifs in a time series. State-of-the-art algorithms
for computing the Matrix Profile are fast enough for many tasks. However, in a handful
of domains, including astronomy and seismology, there is an insatiable appetite to
consider ever larger datasets. In this work we show that with several novel insights
we can push the motif discovery envelope using a novel scalable framework in conjunction
with a deployment to commercial GPU clusters in the cloud. We demonstrate the utility
of our ideas with detailed case studies in seismology, demonstrating that the efficiency
of our algorithm allows us to exhaustively consider datasets that are currently only
approximately searchable, allowing us to find subtle precursor earthquakes that had
previously escaped attention, and other novel seismic regularities.},

                   composed of multiple processing layers to learn
                   representations of data with multiple levels of
                   abstraction. These methods have dramatically improved
                   the state-of-the-art in speech recognition, visual
                   object recognition, object detection and many other
                   domains such as drug discovery and genomics. Deep
                   learning discovers intricate structure in large data
                   sets by using the backpropagation algorithm to
                   indicate how a machine should change its internal
                   parameters that are used to compute the
                   representation in each layer from the representation
                   in the previous layer. Deep convolutional nets have
                   brought about breakthroughs in processing images,
                   video, speech and audio, whereas recurrent nets have
                   shone light on sequential data such as text and
                   speech.},

                   series of groupings of the data arranged in the form
                   of a hierarchy, or tree structure. In most cases, the
                   choice of where to ``cut'' the tree is left to the

in a wide range of domains. However, the approaches that have been proposed so far
in the literature have severe limitations: they either require prior domain knowledge
that is used to design the anomaly discovery algorithms, or become cumbersome and
expensive to use in situations with recurrent anomalies of the same type. In this
work, we address these problems, and propose an unsupervised method suitable for domain
agnostic subsequence anomaly detection. Our method, Series2Graph, is based on a graph
representation of a novel low-dimensionality embedding of subsequences. Series2Graph
needs neither labeled instances (like supervised techniques), nor anomaly-free data
(like zero-positive learning techniques), and identifies anomalies of varying lengths.
The experimental results, on the largest set of synthetic and real datasets used to
date, demonstrate that the proposed approach correctly identifies single and recurrent
anomalies without any prior knowledge of their characteristics, outperforming by a
large margin several competing approaches in accuracy, while being up to orders of
magnitude faster.},

abstract = {The problems of recurrent and anomalous pattern discovery in time series, e.g., motifs
and discords, respectively, have received a lot of attention from researchers in the
past decade. However, since the pattern search space is usually intractable, most
existing detection algorithms require that the patterns have discriminative characteristics
and have its length known in advance and provided as input, which is an unreasonable
requirement for many real-world problems. In addition, patterns of similar structure,
but of different lengths may co-exist in a time series. Addressing these issues, we
have developed algorithms for variable-length time series pattern discovery that are
based on symbolic discretization and grammar inference—two techniques whose combination
enables the structured reduction of the search space and discovery of the candidate
patterns in linear time. In this work, we present GrammarViz 3.0—a software package
that provides implementations of proposed algorithms and graphical user interface
for interactive variable-length time series pattern discovery. The current version
of the software provides an alternative grammar inference algorithm that improves
the time series motif discovery workflow, and introduces an experimental procedure
for automated discretization parameter selection that builds upon the minimum cardinality
maximum cover principle and aids the time series recurrent and anomalous pattern discovery.},

abstract = {Ensembles of randomized decision trees, usually referred to as random forests, are
widely used for classification and regression tasks in machine learning and statistics.
Random forests achieve competitive predictive performance and are computationally
efficient to train and test, making them excellent candidates for real-world prediction
tasks. The most popular random forest variants (such as Breiman's random forest and
extremely randomized trees) operate on batches of training data. Online methods are
now in greater demand. Existing online random forests, however, require more training
data than their batch counterpart to achieve comparable predictive performance. In
this work, we use Mondrian processes (Roy and Teh, 2009) to construct ensembles of
random decision trees we call Mondrian forests. Mondrian forests can be grown in an
incremental/online fashion and remarkably, the distribution of online Mondrian forests
is the same as that of batch Mondrian forests. Mondrian forests achieve competitive
predictive performance comparable with existing online random forests and periodically
retrained batch random forests, while being more than an order of magnitude faster,
thus representing a better computation vs accuracy tradeoff.},

                   commonly used to present results for binary decision
                   problems in machine learning. However, when dealing
                   with highly skewed datasets, Precision-Recall (PR)
                   curves give a more informative picture of an
                   algorithm's performance. We show that a deep
                   connection exists between ROC space and PR space,
                   such that a curve dominates in ROC space if and only
                   if it dominates in PR space. A corollary is the
                   notion of an achievable PR curve, which has
                   properties much like the convex hull in ROC space; we
                   show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve.
                   Finally, we also note differences in the two types of
                   curves are significant for algorithm design. For
                   example, in PR space it is incorrect to linearly
                   interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms
                   that optimize the area under the ROC curve are not
                   guaranteed to optimize the area under the PR curve.},

By explanation we mean the ability of a program to discuss what it is doing in some understandable way. We first present a general framework in which to view explanation and review some of the research done in this area. We then focus on the explanation system for NEOMYCIN, a medical consultation program. A consultation program interactively helps a user to solve a problem. Our goal is to have NEOMYCIN explain its problem-solving strategies. An explanation of strategy describes the plan the program is using to reach a solution. Such an explanation is usually concrete, referring to aspects of the current problem situation. Abstract explanations articulate a general principle, which can be applied in different situations; such explanations are useful in teaching and in explaining by analogy. We describe the aspects of NEOMYCIN that make abstract strategic explanations possible—the representation of strategic knowledge explicitly and separately from domain knowledge— and demonstrate how this representation can be used to generate explanations.}

towards their safe operation. The data-driven algorithms for this task are often heavily
parameterized, and the incorrect hyperparameters can deteriorate their performance.
We tackle this issue and introduce a genetic algorithm for evolving a dynamic thresholding
approach that follows a long short-term memory network in an unsupervised anomaly
detection system. Our experiments show that the genetic algorithm improves the abilities
of a detector operating on multi-channel satellite telemetry.},

Given the large volume of measurements collected by sensor systems, one problem arises—an automated approach to identifying the “interesting” parts of these datasets, or anomaly detection. A good anomaly detection methodology should be able to accurately identify many types of anomaly, be robust, require relatively few resources, and perform detection in (near) real time. Thus, in this paper, we focus on an approach to online anomaly detection in measurements collected by sensor systems, where our evaluation, using real-world datasets, shows that our approach is accurate (it detects over 90\% of the anomalies with few false positives), works well over a range of parameter choices, and has a small (CPU, memory) footprint.},

The resource has 3 interdependent components. PhysioBank is a large and growing archive of well-characterized digital recordings of physiological signals and related data for use by the biomedical research community. It currently includes databases of multiparameter cardiopulmonary, neural, and other biomedical signals from healthy subjects and from patients with a variety of conditions with major public health implications, including life-threatening arrhythmias, congestive heart failure, sleep apnea, neurological disorders, and aging. PhysioToolkit is a library of open-source software for physiological signal processing and analysis, the detection of physiologically significant events using both classic techniques and novel methods based on statistical physics and nonlinear dynamics, the interactive display and characterization of signals, the creation of new databases, the simulation of physiological and other signals, the quantitative evaluation and comparison of analysis methods, and the analysis of nonstationary processes. PhysioNet is an on-line forum for the dissemination and exchange of recorded biomedical signals and open-source software for analyzing them. It provides facilities for the cooperative analysis of data and the evaluation of proposed new algorithms. In addition to providing free electronic access to PhysioBank data and PhysioToolkit software via the World Wide Web (http://www.physionet. org), PhysioNet offers services and training via on-line tutorials to assist users with varying levels of expertise.},

	abstract = {Fast approximate nearest neighbor(NN) search in large databases is becoming popular. Several powerful learning-based formulations have been proposed recently. However, not much attention has been paid to a more fundamental question: how difficult is (approximate) nearest neighbor search in a given data set? And which data properties affect the difficulty of nearest neighbor search and how? This paper introduces the first concrete measure called Relative Contrast that can be used to evaluate the influence of several crucial data characteristics such as dimensionality, sparsity, and database size simultaneously in arbitrary normed metric spaces. Moreover, we present a theoretical analysis to prove how the difficulty measure (relative contrast) determines/affects the complexity of Local Sensitive Hashing, a popular approximate NN search method. Relative contrast also provides an explanation for a family of heuristic hashing algorithms with good practical performance based on PCA. Finally, we show that most of the previous works in measuring NN search meaningfulness/difficulty can be derived as special asymptotic cases for dense vectors of the proposed measure.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection is an important problem that has been well-studied within diverse research areas and application domains. A robust anomaly detection system identifies rare events and patterns in the absence of labelled data. The identified patterns provide crucial insights about both the fidelity of the data and deviations in the underlying data-generating process. For example a surveillance system designed to monitor the emergence of new epidemics will use a robust anomaly detection methods to separate spurious associations from genuine indicators of an epidemic with minimal lag time.The key concept in anomaly detection is the notion of "robustness'', i.e., designing models and representations which are less-sensitive to small changes in the underlying data distribution. The canonical example is that the median is more robust than the mean as an estimator. The tutorial will primarily help researchers and developers design deep learning architectures and loss functions where the learnt representation behave more like the "median'' rather than the "mean.'' The tutorial will revisit well known unsupervised learning techniques in deep learning including autoencoders and generative adversarial networks (GANs) from the perspective of anomaly detection. This in turn will give the audience a more grounded perspective on unsupervised deep learning methods. All the methods will be introduced in a hands-on manner to demonstrate how high-level ideas and concepts get translated to practical real code.},

abstract = {Ensemble analysis has recently been studied in the context of the outlier detection problem. In this paper, we investigate the theoretical underpinnings of outlier ensemble analysis. In spite of the significant differences between the classification and the outlier analysis problems, we show that the theoretical underpinnings between the two problems are actually quite similar in terms of the bias-variance trade-off. We explain the existing algorithms within this traditional framework, and clarify misconceptions about the reasoning underpinning these methods. We propose more effective variants of subsampling and feature bagging. We also discuss the impact of the combination function and discuss the specific trade-offs of the average and maximization functions. We use these insights to propose new combination functions that are robust in many settings.},

abstract = {Anomaly detection (AD) is a fundamental task for time-series analytics with important implications for the downstream performance of many applications. In contrast to other domains where AD mainly focuses on point-based anomalies (i.e., outliers in standalone observations), AD for time series is also concerned with range-based anomalies (i.e., outliers spanning multiple observations). Nevertheless, it is common to use traditional point-based information retrieval measures, such as Precision, Recall, and F-score, to assess the quality of methods by thresholding the anomaly score to mark each point as an anomaly or not. However, mapping discrete labels into continuous data introduces unavoidable shortcomings, complicating the evaluation of range-based anomalies. Notably, the choice of evaluation measure may significantly bias the experimental outcome. Despite over six decades of attention, there has never been a large-scale systematic quantitative and qualitative analysis of time-series AD evaluation measures. This paper extensively evaluates quality measures for time-series AD to assess their robustness under noise, misalignments, and different anomaly cardinality ratios. Our results indicate that measures producing quality values independently of a threshold (i.e., AUC-ROC and AUC-PR) are more suitable for time-series AD. Motivated by this observation, we first extend the AUC-based measures to account for range-based anomalies. Then, we introduce a new family of parameter-free and threshold-independent measures, VUS (Volume Under the Surface), to evaluate methods while varying parameters. Our findings demonstrate that our four measures are significantly more robust in assessing the quality of time-series AD methods.},

While advanced analytics tasks over time series data have been gaining lots of attention, lack of such community resources severely limits scientific progress. In this paper, we present Exathlon, the first comprehensive public benchmark for explainable anomaly detection over high-dimensional time series data. Exathlon has been systematically constructed based on real data traces from repeated executions of large-scale stream processing jobs on an Apache Spark cluster. Some of these executions were intentionally disturbed by introducing instances of six different types of anomalous events (e.g., misbehaving inputs, resource contention, process failures). For each of the anomaly instances, ground truth labels for the root cause interval as well as those for the extended effect interval are provided, supporting the development and evaluation of a wide range of anomaly detection (AD) and explanation discovery (ED) tasks. We demonstrate the practical utility of Exathlon's dataset, evaluation methodology, and end-to-end data science pipeline design through an experimental study with three state-of-the-art AD and ED techniques.},

year = {2022},
isbn = {9781450393850},
abstract = {Anomaly detection is becoming important in modern society as everything goes digital. Consumers are spending a lot more time online, and various digital sensors are placed into physical/chemical equipment for health monitoring. Such monitoring data is growing at an exponential rate, which enables automated anomaly detection in various high-impact domains. In this tutorial, we dive deep into several state-of-art methods for finding anomalies in spatiotemporal data (or more generally, correlated multivariate data), on a few specific use cases such as telecom network performance and user behavior monitoring. We identify suitable methods for specific data representation (i.e. spatial, temporal and categorical dimensionality) for specific use case, and present methods to convert raw data into the formats the existing methods require. Such survey and hands-on exercise is necessary as each use case has its own special data representation and requirements in live applications. Certain methods fit better than others for a specific data format under a specific scenario. With such investigation outlined in this tutorial, we hope attendees will be able to more efficiently choose the most appropriate method for their use case. To reach as wide an audience as possible, we investigate anomaly detection application in multiple domains: telecom network performance, user behavior monitoring, financial transactions, and industrial internet of things. The types of datasets range from univariate, multivariate time series of single or multiple entities, to transactional tabular data with timestamps or sequenced indexes. The types of anomalies in these datasets include contextual anomalies for one entity or collective anomalies aggregated among multiple entities in time series, and suspicious record or user in transactional tabular data. During this three-hour hands-on tutorial, we examine the suitability and performance of different methods for the 4 introduced use cases. The available choices of anomaly detection modeling framework ranges from sequential or time series models, to static graph neural network models and dynamic graph neural network models that learns coupled spatial, structural and temporal information. Among these models, anomaly detection is formulated as a forecast problem for some use cases in which anomaly severity is derived based on the observed value deviation from the predicted value. In other use cases, anomaly detection is solved as a classification problem (either as node, edge classification in graph, row-based classification in tabular data or sequential classification in sequence data). The tutorial combines an introduction of fundamental anomaly detection techniques with hands-on exercises. For the hands-on exercises, we focus on the time series based HTM method introduced in and graph methods introduced in. Participants learn to identify suitable methods, apply data transformation techniques to convert raw data into the formats the different methods assume, and study these methods on the aforementioned real-world or synthetic data sets.},

isbn = {9781450393850},
abstract = {Time series anomaly detection remains one of the most active areas of research in data mining. In spite of the dozens of creative solutions proposed for this problem, recent empirical evidence suggests that time series discords, a relatively simple twenty-year old distance-based technique, remains among the state-of-art techniques. While there are many algorithms for computing the time series discords, they all have limitations. First, they are limited to the batch case, whereas the online case is more actionable. Second, these algorithms exhibit poor scalability beyond tens of thousands of datapoints. In this work we introduce DAMP, a novel algorithm that addresses both these issues. DAMP computes exact left-discords on fast arriving streams, at up to 300,000 Hz using a commodity desktop. This allows us to find time series discords in datasets with trillions of datapoints for the first time. We will demonstrate the utility of our algorithm with the most ambitious set of time series anomaly detection experiments ever conducted.},

	abstract = {Research in anomaly detection suffers from a lack of realistic and publicly-available problem sets. This paper discusses what properties such problem sets should possess. It then introduces a methodology for transforming existing classification data sets into ground-truthed benchmark data sets for anomaly detection. The methodology produces data sets that vary along three important dimensions: (a) point difficulty, (b) relative frequency of anomalies, and (c) clusteredness. We apply our generated datasets to benchmark several popular anomaly detection algorithms under a range of different conditions.},

	isbn = {978-1-4503-1285-1},
	abstract = {Fast approximate nearest neighbor(NN) search in large databases is becoming popular. Several powerful learning-based formulations have been proposed recently. However, not much attention has been paid to a more fundamental question: how difficult is (approximate) nearest neighbor search in a given data set? And which data properties affect the difficulty of nearest neighbor search and how? This paper introduces the first concrete measure called Relative Contrast that can be used to evaluate the influence of several crucial data characteristics such as dimensionality, sparsity, and database size simultaneously in arbitrary normed metric spaces. Moreover, we present a theoretical analysis to prove how the difficulty measure (relative contrast) determines/affects the complexity of Local Sensitive Hashing, a popular approximate NN search method. Relative contrast also provides an explanation for a family of heuristic hashing algorithms with good practical performance based on PCA. Finally, we show that most of the previous works in measuring NN search meaningfulness/difficulty can be derived as special asymptotic cases for dense vectors of the proposed measure.},

abstract = {The accuracy of the prediction of occupancy in an office room using data from light, temperature, humidity and CO2 sensors has been evaluated with different statistical classification models using the open source program R. Three data sets were used in this work, one for training, and two for testing the models considering the office door opened and closed during occupancy. Typically the best accuracies (ranging from 95\% to 99\%) are obtained from training Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Classification and Regression Trees (CART) and Random Forest (RF) models. The results show that a proper selection of features together with an appropriate classification model can have an important impact on the accuracy prediction. Information from the time stamp has been included in the models, and usually it increases the accuracy of the detection. Interestingly, using only one predictor (temperature) the LDA model was able to estimate the occupancy with accuracies of 85\% and 83\% in the two testing sets.}

abstract = {Industry devices (i.e., entities) such as server machines, spacecrafts, engines, etc., are typically monitored with multivariate time series, whose anomaly detection is critical for an entity's service quality management. However, due to the complex temporal dependence and stochasticity of multivariate time series, their anomaly detection remains a big challenge. This paper proposes OmniAnomaly, a stochastic recurrent neural network for multivariate time series anomaly detection that works well robustly for various devices. Its core idea is to capture the normal patterns of multivariate time series by learning their robust representations with key techniques such as stochastic variable connection and planar normalizing flow, reconstruct input data by the representations, and use the reconstruction probabilities to determine anomalies. Moreover, for a detected entity anomaly, OmniAnomaly can provide interpretations based on the reconstruction probabilities of its constituent univariate time series. The evaluation experiments are conducted on two public datasets from aerospace and a new server machine dataset (collected and released by us) from an Internet company. OmniAnomaly achieves an overall F1-Score of 0.86 in three real-world datasets, signicantly outperforming the best performing baseline method by 0.09. The interpretation accuracy for OmniAnomaly is up to 0.89.},

However, the training of ViTs is much harder than CNNs, as it is sensitive to the training parameters, such as learning rate, optimizer and warmup epoch. The reasons for training difficulty are empirically analysed in the paper Early Convolutions Help Transformers See Better, and the authors conjecture that the issue lies with the patchify-stem of ViT models. In this paper, we further investigate this problem and extend the above conclusion: only early convolutions do not help for stable training, but the scaled ReLU operation in the convolutional stem (conv-stem) matters. We verify, both theoretically and empirically, that scaled ReLU in conv-stem not only improves training stabilization, but also increases the diversity of patch tokens, thus boosting peak performance with a large margin via adding few parameters and flops. In addition, extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate that previous ViTs are far from being well trained, further showing that ViTs have great potential to be a better substitute of CNNs.}, number={3}, journal={Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence}, author={Wang, Pichao and Wang, Xue and Luo, Hao and Zhou, Jingkai and Zhou, Zhipeng and Wang, Fan and Li, Hao and Jin, Rong}, year={2022}, month={Jun.}, pages={2495-2503} }
